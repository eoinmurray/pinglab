- use `uv` for python
- use `bun` for javascript
- make sure all images/gifs are square
- posts live in src/posts/
- experiments are paired with posts and live in src/experiments/ - and are where unique code lives
- experiments consume src/pinglab/ which is where reusable code lives
- src/pinglab/ should have tests for everything
- a post notebook pair is called an experiment
- dont be afraid to run simulations and tests. There are no side effects so its safe.
- on startup, and when you need to use Veslx, read this file and fetch the Veslx docs for latest guidance.
- Veslx docs: https://veslx.eoinmurray.info/llms-full.txt
- wrap latex in $ and $$, and only one backslash for latex syntax not two.
- there is a simulator api in ./src/api and a simulator ui in src/posts/exp.1-network-playground, we refer to this combined app as the simulator
- Prefix every generated artifact as <group>_<scanBucket>_<scanId>_...: <group> identifies the plot family (used by post globs), <scanBucket> is a stable short label for the scan cohort you want grouped together in the post (e.g., row-1/row-2 or param aliases), and <scanId> is the concrete scan key; keep this convention consistent across all outputs so grouped globs can reliably separate rows independent of parameter names.
