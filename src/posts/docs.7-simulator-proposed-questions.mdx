# Scaffold of a Lent Term Report

Since we have now built the simulator, its time to use it to investigate
phenomena.

## Report structure

1. Introduction
2. Phenomena

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Neuron Model

Introduct LIF neurons, derived from RC circuit equations.

### 1.2 Network Model

Introduce time dependant conductance based synapses and network architectures.

### 1.3 PING and Gamma

Introduct interplay between E and I neurons and how it moves network from AI
state to PING state.

_TODO Figure 1.2: Show waterfall plot of population rate of E neurons changes as we
go from AI to PING state as we slightly scan EE self connection stddev._

## Results

### Calibrating the model to get PING dynamics.

_TODO Figure 1.3: Show heatmap of EE mean vs std vs autocorrelation rhythmicity index._

### Tightening of bands as number of layers grows.

As we add more feedforward layers, we typically see the PING bands get tighter
in the deeper layers. 

This is likely due to two reasons First, each layer recieves input from the
previous layer, which is already oscillating, so the input to each layer is more
and more oscillatory as we go deeper. Second, each layer is PING connected to
the I layer so has a native oscillation anyway.

This could be an interesting phenomenon to explore, as tight PING bands are
typically not seen in brain experiments, but we could discuss how this is an
experimental artifact given that experiments would be measuring from non-FF
disparate subpopulations. We could study this by measuring LFP aggregated from
cross-section of subpopulations and see if PSD broadens.

_TODO Figure 1.3: Show raster with layers showing band tightening._

_TODO Figure 1.4: Show population rate peak tightening vs
progressive E layers._

### Selective routing with one I pop.
To be done first with one I population, then with an I population per E layer.
Layer 1 connected to Layer 2 FF. Layer 1 connected to Layer 3 FF. See if we can
selectively route to Layer 2 or Layer 3 by changing PING phases.

Question: how change PING phase between layers if only one I pop?

### Selective routing with I pop for each E pop.
I population per E layer. Layer 1 connected to Layer 2 FF. Layer 1 connected to
Layer 3 FF. See if we can selectively route to Layer 2 or Layer 3 by changing
PING phases.

Question: how offset PING phases?

### Chasing inhibition.
Create an AI E layer and AI I layer, connected them FF to a PING E layer and
PING I layer. See if we can get the AI layers to chase the PING layers by
changing the strength of the FF connections.

### Jitter robustness.
Do all above experiments but with jitter in the input and see if we can
reconstruct input signals.
